    "### Most people think about snakes, and even the logo depicts two snakes, but the origin of the name has its root in British humour. Around December 1989, Guido van Rossum decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language- a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. So he chose \"Python\" as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood as he is a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus."
