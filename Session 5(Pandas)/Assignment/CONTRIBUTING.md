# Contributor guidelines

First of all, thank you very much for considering helping out with building a great set of practice exercises for the python data science stack!

## What to contribute
When contributing new exercises, please keep the following in mind:
1. A set of exercises should be five exercises in a Jupyter Notebook
2. The first cells in the notebook should import all relevant packages and data. (If the exercises is regarding loading and writing data, you should of course not import the data)
3. New sets of exercises should not cover any topics already covered in the previous exercises, unless your exercises illustrates important points not already covered. You should be able to justify the need for another set of exercises on the topic
4. Try to reuse data sets already in the repository or generate the data in the notebook directly
5. Provide a notebook with solutions in the Solutions folder. The name of the notebook should match the name of the notebook with the unsolved exercises
6. Any result in the solution should be 100% reproduciable, i.e. seeds and random_states should be set explicitly
7. Have sufficient explanatory text before each exercise
8. Give the necessary hints for each exercise. Remember this is intended for learning, not showing off the author's skills
9. Always run the clean-up script, before submitting a Pull Request

## Review process
When submitting a pull request, I will
* Take time to walk through your exercises. This is done to test whether the exercises are formulated clearly
* Run the solution notebook a couple of times to ensure the consistency of the results

## Credit
You are free to add name and contact information in the exercise sets you create or remain anonymous. Just remember that any exercises, solutions and data you submit to the repository will be treated under the MIT license.

Thank you for helping out!
